### 🌾 Wheat Disease Classification using VGG19

This project focuses on automated wheat disease detection using deep learning (VGG19). It classifies images of wheat plants into four categories:

* Crown and Root Rot

* Healthy Wheat

* Leaf Rust

* Loose Smut

### 🧠 Model Overview

* Base Model: VGG19 (pre-trained on ImageNet)

* Custom Layers: AveragePooling2D → Flatten → Dense → Dropout → Softmax

* Optimizer: Adam

* Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

* Accuracy Achieved: ~93% on validation data

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* Languages: Python

* Libraries: TensorFlow / Keras, NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

* Environment: Google Colab

### 📊 Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled wheat images stored in Google Drive with four disease classes.
Each image is preprocessed (resized to 224×224 and normalized) before training.

### 🚀 Model Training

* Data Augmentation using ImageDataGenerator

* 70–30 train-test split

* 50 epochs with early performance improvement

* Trained model saved as model.h5

### 🧾 Evaluation

* Accuracy: 93.1%

* Metrics: Confusion Matrix & Classification Report

* Visualization: Accuracy & Loss curves

### 🔍 Testing

You can test the model on new wheat images using:

```
model = load_model("model.h5")
```

The model outputs the predicted disease name on the image.

### 📦 Output Example

* Prediction: PREDICTION: LEAF RUST

* Visual Output: Displays the input image with the predicted label overlay.
